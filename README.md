# Translator
A translator made with python

Made for the first-ever hackathon attended in online-mode, Hack-dot-slash 2.0. Picked on the theme of global connection of the people, my team went on to make a translator which works on Voice as well
on typing the text and then converting it into the desired languages.

Libraries used in the project <br>
Tkinter : Making of GUI with this library<br>
pyttsx3 : Text to speech conversion library<br>
speech_recognition: For understanding the speech, and currently set on "English language" <br>
googltrans: Library to convert the language <br>
