# Translator
A translator made with python

Made for the first-ever hackathon attended in online-mode, Hack-dot-slash 2.0. Picked on the theme of global connection of the people, my team went on to make a translator which works on Voice as well
on typing the text and then converting it into the desired languages.

Libraries used in the project
Tkinter : Making of GUI with this library
pyttsx3 : Text to speech conversion library
speech_recognition: For understanding the speech, and currently set on "English language".
googltrans: Library to convert the language
